**IndiaLawAI** leverages multi-modal generative AI to score documents for compliance, identify risks in multiple languages, and provide actionable insights, turning complex legal jargon into clear, measurable data.

This tool moves beyond simple analysis by introducing the **"IndiaLaw Score,"** a proprietary metric that quantifies a document's compliance with Indian regulations.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Compliance Scoring**: Instead of a simple pass/fail, IndiaLawAI generates a quantifiable **IndiaLaw Score (0-100)**, with a detailed breakdown across key legal categories like Labor Law, GST, and Contractual Obligations. This allows users to track compliance improvements over time.

- **Intelligent Multilingual Document Analysis**:
  - **Seamless Translation**: The app supports **English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi** end-to-end. Users can upload documents and receive analysis in their native language.
  - **Advanced OCR**: Utilizes **Google Cloud Vision API** for high-accuracy text extraction from complex documents, including scanned PDFs and images in multiple languages.

- **Interactive Q&A**: Engage in a natural language conversation with your legal documents. Ask specific questions ("What is the notice period required by this contract?") and receive precise, AI-powered answers with references to the relevant clauses.

- **Value-Driven Insights**: The analysis dashboard doesn't just show problems; it highlights the business impact by estimating **potential costs avoided** and **manual review time saved**.

- **Secure User Authentication**: Full authentication system powered by **Firebase Auth**, supporting both Google Sign-In and traditional email/password, ensuring user data and analysis history are secure.

- **User Profile Management**: A dedicated settings page allows users to manage their profile information, including display name and avatar.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

This application is built with a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack, carefully chosen to deliver a high-performance and feature-rich experience.

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: **Next.js (with App Router)** for server-side rendering, ensuring fast page loads.
- **Language**: **TypeScript** for strong typing and improved code quality.
- **UI Library**: **React** with Hooks for building a stateful, interactive user interface.
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first, consistent design system.
- **Components**: **ShadCN UI** for a set of accessible and beautifully designed UI components.

### Backend & AI Architecture

- **AI Toolkit**: **Genkit** is used to orchestrate all AI-powered workflows (Flows), providing a structured framework for prompt engineering, schema definition with **Zod**, and chaining AI calls.
- **Language Model (LLM)**: **Google Gemini** is the core AI model for all analytical tasks, including compliance analysis, summarization, and Q&A.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: **Google Cloud Vision API** is integrated via a Genkit flow for high-accuracy, multilingual text extraction.
- **Server-Side Logic**: **Next.js Server Actions** handle all form submissions and communication with the backend AI flows, eliminating the need for traditional REST API endpoints.

### Platform & Services

- **Authentication**: **Firebase Authentication** for secure user login and management (Google & Email/Password).
- **Database**: **Cloud Firestore** for storing user data and application state.
- **Storage**: **Firebase Storage** for securely uploading and managing user documents.

## Local Development

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- A Firebase project with **Authentication, Firestore, and Storage** enabled.

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project with the following variables:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Google Gemini API Key (for AI functionality)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

- In your Firebase project console, go to **Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains** and add the domain of your development environment (e.g., `localhost`, `cloudworkstations.dev`).
- Copy your Firebase configuration values from the Firebase console and add them to your `.env.local` file.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`. You will be prompted to log in or sign up before you can access the analysis workbench.
